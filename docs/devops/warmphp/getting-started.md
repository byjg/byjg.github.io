# Getting started

WarmPHP keeps your PHP application booted in memory and serves HTTP with it, using the
plain PHP CLI. You put it behind your usual web server, as you would PHP-FPM.

You need a PHP 8.1 or newer CLI to run it, from your distribution or any image.
Install WarmPHP from the [ByJG package repository](https://opensource.byjg.com/docs/packages),
use Homebrew, or build from source as described below. Only the source build needs Go installed manually.
The binary carries its PHP files, so it runs from any folder, on its own.

## Install PHP

WarmPHP uses the PHP you already have: nothing is built for it. `-mode prefork` also needs the `pcntl`
and `posix` extensions. Without them the gateway refuses `-mode prefork` when it starts and names what is
missing, for example:

```
-mode prefork needs PHP's pcntl and posix extensions, and this PHP lacks posix_kill: install them (see Requirements in the README), or use -mode worker
```

`-mode worker` and `-mode legacy` need neither.

### Ubuntu (apt)

```bash
sudo apt install php-cli          # pcntl and posix are included
```

Your application's extensions are packages too: `php-mysql`, `php-mbstring`, `php-xml`...
Tested on Ubuntu 26.04, PHP 8.5.4.

### Fedora (dnf)

```bash
sudo dnf install php-cli php-process   # php-process brings posix; pcntl is in php-cli
```

Without `php-process`, `-mode prefork` is refused for `posix_kill`. Tested on Fedora 44, PHP 8.5.12.

### Docker's official image

`php:8.5-cli` has `posix` but not `pcntl`. As it is, it runs the plain workers; for `-mode prefork`, add
`pcntl` with the image's own tool:

```dockerfile
FROM php:8.5-cli
RUN docker-php-ext-install pcntl
```

Then run PHP through it, as in [PHP in Docker](#7-php-in-docker). Tested with PHP 8.5.12.

### byjg/php images

`byjg/php:8.5-cli` and `byjg/php:8.5-fpm-nginx` have `pcntl` and `posix`. They load Xdebug in
`develop` mode, which slows every request, so turn it off:

```bash
./warmphp \
  -php "docker run --rm -i --init -v $PWD:$PWD -v /tmp:/tmp -u $(id -u):$(id -g) byjg/php:8.5-cli php -d xdebug.mode=off" \
  examples/hello/app.php
```

`make test` runs on `byjg/php:8.5-fpm-nginx` by default, and the benchmark uses it. Tested with PHP 8.5.12.

## 1. Install or build

### Install from ByJG packages

For Debian/Ubuntu or Fedora/RHEL, first follow the
[ByJG repository setup instructions](https://opensource.byjg.com/docs/packages#setup)
for your distribution. Then install WarmPHP:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu, after adding the ByJG APT repository
sudo apt install warmphp

# Fedora/RHEL, after adding the ByJG RPM repository
sudo dnf install warmphp
```

For macOS or Linux with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install byjg/tap/warmphp
```

Homebrew installs Go as a build dependency automatically. For Alpine packages, see
[the README's Alpine instructions](https://github.com/byjg/warmphp#alpine).

After package or Homebrew installation, run `warmphp` from your PATH instead of `./warmphp`.
You can run your own application directly; the example below uses files from a source checkout.

### Build from source

From a source checkout, with Go installed:

```bash
make build
```

This gives `./warmphp`, a static binary for this machine. For another one:
`make build GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64`.

## 2. Run the example

```bash
./warmphp -workers 4 examples/hello/app.php
curl 'localhost:8080/?name=ana'
```

Call it a few times: `requests_served` grows, because the application is not booted again.

## 3. Run your application

The gateway runs an **entry file**: it boots once per worker (once for all of them with
`-mode prefork`), then handles every request.

### 3.1 Your own code

The entry boots once and returns the function that handles each request:

```php
<?php
// app.php: runs once per worker
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
$app = buildMyApplication();          // container, routes, configuration...

return static function () use ($app): void {
    $app->handle();                   // runs on every request, with $_GET, $_POST, $_SERVER...
};
```

```bash
./warmphp app.php
```

An **old-style `index.php`** that does everything at the top level can run as it is, with
`-mode legacy`. It is included again on every request, but the worker process stays: the classes,
functions and `require_once` files it loaded stay loaded, and an edit to them is not seen until the
worker is replaced. It gains less than `-mode worker`; read the rules in
[`-mode legacy`](https://github.com/byjg/warmphp#-mode-legacy-a-front-controller-in-a-persistent-process) first:

```bash
./warmphp -mode legacy public/index.php
```

Which mode for which case: [When to use each mode](https://github.com/byjg/warmphp#when-to-use-each-mode).

### 3.2 Existing frameworks

A framework's own `index.php` boots it on every request, and most break when it is included twice.
The binary has an entry for each framework instead, from [`compat/`](https://github.com/byjg/warmphp/tree/master/compat): it boots the
framework once and handles each request the way the framework's own worker runtime does. Your
application is not changed; `-framework` picks the entry and `-project-root` says where your
application is:

```bash
./warmphp -framework symfony -project-root /path/to/my-symfony-app
```

The `PROJECT_ROOT` variable does the same, if you prefer it; `-project-root` wins over it.

| `-framework`     | Status                                                                                       |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `symfony`        | ✅ one kernel, reset between requests                                                         |
| `cakephp`        | ✅ one application, a new container per request                                              |
| `codeigniter`    | ✅ its own worker mode                                                                        |
| `gluo`           | ✅ one `Application` (byjg/gluo-core 7.0; older Gluo projects are not supported)              |
| `laravel-shared` | ✅ one application, its session, login and array cache reset between requests; for state your application changes during a request (config, locale), see [compatibility.md](compatibility) |
| `laravel-fresh`  | ⚠️ builds a new application per request: little gain, and it needs `-max-requests` (e.g. 100) |

Each entry was tested on a real application of that framework, without changing it:
[compatibility.md](compatibility) has the results and what each entry works around.

**Another framework, or a change to an entry?** Write the PHP files out and pass the entry you
changed, keeping it beside the entries it requires:

```bash
./warmphp -extract ./warmphp-php
./warmphp -project-root /path/to/app ./warmphp-php/compat/my-framework.php
```

An entry has to do three things: boot the framework once, return a function that builds the
framework's request from the globals (`PhpWorker::input()` for the body) and sends its response,
and reset what the framework keeps per request. Look for the framework's FrankenPHP or RoadRunner
integration: it does the same.

### 3.3 While you develop: `-watch`

A worker keeps the code it booted with. With `-watch`, the gateway replaces the workers when a file
of the application changes, and the next request runs the new code:

```bash
./warmphp -watch -workers 1 app.php
```

It watches the application's folder (`-project-root`, or the nearest folder with a `composer.json`
up from the entry), skips `vendor/` and the folders frameworks write to (`var/`, `storage/`,
`cache/`...), and does not work with `-mode prefork`. The log names the files that changed, then
says `reloaded: every worker runs the new code` once the new code is up. Details:
[Development: `-watch`](https://github.com/byjg/warmphp#development--watch).

## 4. Reading request bodies

`php://input` is empty, because PHP runs as a CLI. Read the raw request body with
`PhpWorker::input()` instead:

```php
$data = json_decode(PhpWorker::input(), true);
```

The worker provides `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_FILES`, `$_COOKIE`, response headers, cookies, sessions
and output. See the [supported behavior and limitations](https://github.com/byjg/warmphp#what-the-worker-provides-on-each-request).
Framework boot files handle request-body adaptation for the supported frameworks. Your application
must also reset request-specific state and, with prefork, open connections lazily; see
[What to watch for](#what-to-watch-for).

## 5. Put nginx in front

nginx serves your static files and passes the rest to the gateway:

```nginx
upstream php {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080;
    keepalive 16;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    root /path/to/my-app/public;

    location / {
        try_files $uri @php;
    }

    location @php {
        proxy_pass http://php;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

With Caddy it is one line: `reverse_proxy localhost:8080`.

## 6. Production settings

These values are starting points, not measured capacity limits. More workers can increase memory
use and database connections; choose worker and recycling counts for your application.

```bash
./warmphp -listen 127.0.0.1:8080 -workers 4 -mode prefork -max-requests 1000 -timeout 30s app.php
```

| Flag                 | What it is for                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-workers 4`         | Up to four requests in PHP at once; one per CPU core is a starting point, then measure your workload                           |
| `-mode prefork`      | Boots once and forks the workers: they share OPcache and memory, so they use much less of it    |
| `-max-requests 1000` | Replaces a worker after that many requests, in case your application leaks memory              |
| `-timeout 30s`       | Up to 30 seconds to wait for a worker and process the request; timeout returns 504 and an active timed-out worker is replaced                              |

Turn OPcache on for the CLI (`opcache.enable_cli=1`, in `php.ini` or with `-php "php -d opcache.enable_cli=1"`).

The gateway logs JSON on stderr: a record per request with its time, CPU and memory in PHP, and PHP's
errors, warnings and `error_log()`. An OpenTelemetry Collector can read them; see
[Logs](https://github.com/byjg/warmphp#logs).

## 7. PHP in Docker

`-php` is the command that runs PHP. It must keep stdin open (`-i`), and `--init` lets PHP stop
cleanly:

```bash
./warmphp \
  -php "docker run --rm -i --init -v $PWD:$PWD -v /tmp:/tmp -u $(id -u):$(id -g) php:8.5-cli php" \
  examples/hello/app.php
```

PHP must see `-upload-dir` (the system's temp folder by default, hence `-v /tmp:/tmp`): the gateway
writes its PHP files there when it starts. Without that, PHP stops with "Could not open input file".
Environment variables do not reach the container unless you pass them with `-e`; `-project-root`
does, as it is an argument.

The gateway checks the command before it starts any worker, and stops with what is wrong: not
found, failed (with PHP's or Docker's error), or not passing stdin, as a wrapper script that adds
`-i` only when stdin is a terminal:

```
the PHP command "php" does not pass its stdin through to PHP, and the gateway sends every request on it: a wrapper script or container must keep stdin open (docker run -i)
```

## What to watch for

The application stays in memory between requests, so:

- **Do not keep request data in static properties or global variables.** The next request, maybe
  another user's, sees it.
- **With `-mode prefork`, open database and cache connections on the first request, not at boot**:
  a connection opened at boot would be shared by every worker.
- **A fatal error or `exit()` is fine**: the request is answered and the worker is replaced.
