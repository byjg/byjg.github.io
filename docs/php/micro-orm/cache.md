# Caching the Results

The `AnyDatasetDb` library has a built-in cache mechanism that can be used to cache the results of a query. 
This is useful when you have a query that is expensive to run and you want to cache the results for a 
certain amount of time.

To enable caching, you need to pass a `CacheQueryResult` object when youÂ´ll query the database.

Here is an example of how to use the cache mechanism:

```php
<?php

$query = Query::getInstance()
    ->where('id = :id1', ['id1'=>3]);

$cacheEngine = /* any SimpleCache implementation */;

// Get the result and save to cache
$result = $repository->getByQuery($query, cache: new CacheQueryResult($cacheEngine, 120));
```

In this example, the result of the query will be saved in the cache for 120 seconds.

The `CacheQueryResult` object has the following parameters:

- `cacheEngine`: The cache engine to use. It must implement the `Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface` interface.
- `ttl`: The time-to-live of the cache in seconds. If the cache is older than this value, it will be considered expired.
