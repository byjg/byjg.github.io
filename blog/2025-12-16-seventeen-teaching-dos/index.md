# Seventeen Teaching DOS - Turning Doubt Into Confidence

![Seventeen Teaching DOS cover](./image.png)

My first professional job was as an instructor in a small computer school, teaching DOS, WordStar, SuperCalc, and dBASE. 
One day I was sent to train a company director. He looked at me - a 17-year-old kid - 
and asked: "You're here to train me? Don't you think you're too young?"

I took a breath and answered: "They sent me because they believe I'm capable. Let's do this: 
I'm already here and you blocked the time. I'll teach today's lesson. 
If you don't like it, you don't pay and someone else comes next week. If you like it, I'll be back." 

He looked surprised, smirked, and said: "Deal!" At the end I asked, "Can I come next week?" His answer: "Yes."

That day I learned how to turn a difficult moment into an opportunity to prove my value. 
I could have accepted his doubt as defeat; instead, I used it to show what I could do.

When we're hunting for a new job, bills to pay and family responsibilities can make every challenge feel like a threat. 
It's easy to shrink. But the world doesn't get to define our limits: we do. 
The confidence to stand your ground, deliver, and let the result speak for itself is a muscle. 
We all forget it sometimes. I did. Revisiting that memory reminds me that courage and preparation beat doubt every time.
